# SOLID

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of various design patterns and principles in Java. The main focus is on the SOLID principles, which are a set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. The project includes examples of the following design patterns and principles:

- Decorator Pattern
- Dependency Inversion Principle
- Finite State Machine Pattern
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Open/Closed Principle
- Specification Pattern
- Strategy Pattern using Enums
- Tell, Don't Ask Principle
- Template Pattern
- Generics

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the SOLID principles and various design patterns. By studying and experimenting with the provided examples, developers can learn how to apply these principles and patterns to create better software designs.

## Functionality

The project includes multiple modules, each demonstrating a specific design pattern or principle. Each module contains example code that illustrates the implementation and usage of the pattern or principle.

## Setup and Running the Project

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Apache Maven

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SOLID.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd SOLID
   ```
3. Build the project using Maven:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. Run the examples:
   ```
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.MainClass"
   ```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple modules, each representing a specific design pattern or principle. The main components of the project are as follows:

- `decoratorPattern`: Demonstrates the Decorator Pattern
- `dependencyInversionPrinciple`: Demonstrates the Dependency Inversion Principle
- `finiteStateMachinePattern`: Demonstrates the Finite State Machine Pattern
- `liskovsSubstitutionPrinciple`: Demonstrates the Liskov Substitution Principle
- `openClosedPrinciple`: Demonstrates the Open/Closed Principle
- `specificationPattern`: Demonstrates the Specification Pattern
- `strategyPatternUsingEnums`: Demonstrates the Strategy Pattern using Enums
- `tellDontAsk`: Demonstrates the Tell, Don't Ask Principle
- `templatePattern`: Demonstrates the Template Pattern
- `generics`: Demonstrates the usage of Generics in Java
